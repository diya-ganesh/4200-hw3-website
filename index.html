                <p>I'm Diya Ganesh, a second-year student at Northeastern University! I'm working towards a combined degree in Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience. My home college is the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, but I am also part of the John Martinson Honors Program. I'm passionate about data analysis and love working with numbers, patterns, and insights. I have a strong interest in data analysis and love working with complex datasets to uncover patterns and insights. Currently, I'm an undergraduate research assistant at the Speech, Hearing and Communication Laboratory at Northeastern, where I analyze large neuroscience datasets, apply data visualization techniques, and study behavioral trends related to auditory processing.
                    
                    Outside of academics, I'm a huge TV show enthusiast. I don't necessarily chase critically acclaimed or "objectively good" showsâ€”what matters to me is pure enjoyment. I love sitcoms and crime comedies, especially ones with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and engaging storylines. My all-time favorite show is Psych, a perfect blend of humor, mystery, and clever storytelling. There's something special about a show that makes you laugh while keeping you hooked on a great mystery.
                    
                    For me, TV is all about fun, comfort, and great storytelling. Whether I'm analyzing data or binging a new series, I'm always looking for something engaging and entertaining. If you have any recommendations for shows that I should watch, I'm all ears!</p>
